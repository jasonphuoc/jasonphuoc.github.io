        <h2>A meditation timer with a mindfulness bell.</h2>

        <p>Sit With Me is a simple meditation app with a timer feature as well as a scheduled bells feature. The timer lets you time your meditation. It includes bell sounds and a handful of ambient sounds. The bells feature allows you to set bell sounds at regular intervals. </p>
        
        <p>This is the second iOS app I've worked on, and my first solo app, so if you have suggestions for improvements, please let me know! I hope to include more bell sounds as well as improve on the quality of the sounds in future releases.</p>
